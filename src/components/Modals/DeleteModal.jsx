                    Deleting this book will erase it from your Wishlist. This can not be reversed and you would have to add it all over again.

                    Remember this is a list of books you want to read somewhere in the future. This  can be in the near future or in a more distant one.

                <p>
                    Also, if you have finished reading it, we recommend keeping it for future reference. Remember to mark it as read and add a review.
